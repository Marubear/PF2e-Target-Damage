- Fixed a harmless console error.

- Updated localization files (French, Polish, Simplified Chinese).
- Made the modules errors slightly more readable, and made an erroring token not stop the entire rendering process, allowing other targets to be shown.

- On Basic Saves, the appropriate damage button will now be highlighted depending on the saving throw of the target. ([#32](https://github.com/MrVauxs/PF2e-Target-Damage/issues/32))

# 2.3.3

- Fixed Saving Throw buttons in spells with Variants. The buttons disappear if there is no saving throw present in the variant.

# 2.3.0

- Added support for Saving Throws in spells.
- Added hover tooltips to compact names.
- Added an exposed `pf2eTargetDamage` object containing functions to update a message's target flags, for ease of use in macros and other modules.
  - Currently the only functions that exist are `updateFlags` and `replaceFlags`. The latter of which is just a shortcut for `updateFlags` with `opts.replace = true`.
- Updated localization files.

# 2.2.2

- Fixed the target token being selected when clicking the Splash button. The splash damage is already calculated into the target damage by the system.

# 2.2.1

- Added automatic scroll down to the last row of buttons on the message.

  - Select the token if owned by the player.
  - Target the token if not owned by the player.
  - Pan to the token if double clicked.

- Fixed bug the Shield button not turning off once used.

# 1.4.1

- Added localization.

# 1.4.0

- Fixed the module not working on PF2e 4.3.0

# 1.3.0

- Fixed an issue where damage buttons were shown to all players even if they didn't own the token, thus couldn't apply damage. Now the module hides damage buttons if you don't own the token itself, rather than having the token belong to _any_ player.
- Fixed only the first target being highlighted on hover. ([#5](https://github.com/MrVauxs/PF2e-Target-Damage/issues/5))
- Made the module override ignore targeting if the message comes from [PF2e Persistent Damage](https://github.com/CarlosFdez/pf2e-persistent-damage). ([#4](https://github.com/MrVauxs/PF2e-Target-Damage/issues/4))
